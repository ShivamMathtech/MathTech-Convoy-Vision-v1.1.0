Runtime dependencies are installed from their upstream packages rather than vendored in this ZIP. Retain their notices when redistributing installed binaries. Optional training additionally uses Ultralytics, PyTorch, torchvision and ONNX under their upstream licenses. Ultralytics offers an enterprise licensing route for deployments that do not use its AGPL terms; see `https://www.ultralytics.com/license` for current information.

UI icons are original simple SVG path drawings in `frontend/app.js`. The MathTech shield in `frontend/logo.svg` is an original code-drawn asset for this package. No third-party CDN, tracking script or external font is loaded by the dashboard.
